An implementation of the ADSD hotel example.

You need to have RazorGenerator VS extension installed
You need to run VS as admin in order to have access to migrations cmdlets
Uses localdb by default
You'll need the dependencies for NServiceBus (MSMQ,RavenDB,DTC)
It'll send e-mails via localhost, I use papercut to intercept them

To think about:
- Obtain reservation details published by branding or reservation service
- Who owns urls
- If site owns urls, how to communicate with service (now done via events)

TODO:
* move all to/till date fields to checkout date
* interpret denied reason in e-mails
* implement pricing service
* implement room details service
* distinguish between services' webinterface per endpoint (frontdesk/customer)
* find way to inject javascript without wrapping div
* be able to run services' webinterface standalone
